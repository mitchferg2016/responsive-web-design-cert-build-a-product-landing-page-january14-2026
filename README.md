Product Landing Page – Northwind Brew
Completed: January 14, 2026
Platform: freeCodeCamp
Project Type: HTML & CSS

Project Overview
This project is a Product Landing Page built as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.
The goal was to design a realistic marketing-style landing page for a product using semantic HTML and modern CSS layout techniques.
The page includes a fixed navigation bar, internal section navigation, a product video, a signup form with HTML5 validation, and responsive behavior across screen sizes.
No JavaScript was required for functionality — all layout, navigation, and validation are handled using HTML and CSS.

What This Project Demonstrates
- Semantic HTML structure using header, nav, section, main, form, and footer elements
- Internal page navigation using anchor links (href="#section_id")
- Fixed navigation bar that stays visible at the top of the viewport
- Embedded media using an iframe video
- Form handling with built-in HTML5 email validation
- Responsive layout design using CSS Flexbox
- Responsive behavior using CSS media queries
- Clean separation of structure (HTML) and styling (CSS)

CSS Concepts Learned (In Simple Terms)
- Flexbox: A layout system that makes it easy to align and space items in rows or columns
- Fixed positioning: Keeping the navigation bar visible while scrolling
- Media queries: Changing styles based on screen size to support mobile devices
- Box model control: Using margin, padding, and borders to control spacing
- Responsive sizing: Making layouts adjust smoothly across different screen widths

Key Concepts Explained (For Future Reference)
Semantic HTML: HTML elements that clearly describe their role, improving accessibility and maintainability
Anchor navigation: Clicking links that scroll to sections on the same page using element IDs
Fixed navigation bar: A header that remains visible at the top of the screen while content scrolls
HTML5 form validation: Letting the browser validate input (like email format) without JavaScript
Flexbox layout: A modern CSS layout method that simplifies alignment and responsive design
Media query: CSS rules that only apply at certain screen sizes

Notes
This project reinforces core front-end fundamentals such as semantic markup, layout control, responsive design, and clean separation of concerns.
It closely mirrors real-world marketing and product pages built using HTML and CSS only.
