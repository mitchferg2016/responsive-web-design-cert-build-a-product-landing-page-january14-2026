# Product Landing Page – Northwind Brew

**Completed:** January 14, 2026  
**Platform:** freeCodeCamp  
**Project Type:** HTML & CSS  

## Project Overview
This project is a Product Landing Page built as part of a freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design challenge.  
The goal was to create a realistic marketing-style landing page using semantic HTML and responsive CSS, similar to real-world product and startup websites.

The page includes a fixed navigation bar, internal section navigation, a product demo video, and an email signup form with built-in HTML5 validation.  
No JavaScript was used — all layout, navigation, and form behavior are handled with HTML and CSS only.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Semantic HTML structure using `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `form`, `input`, `iframe`, and `footer`
- Internal page navigation using anchor links (`href="#section_id"`)
- Fixed-position navigation bar that stays visible while scrolling
- Embedded product video using an `iframe`
- HTML5 form handling with built-in email validation
- Responsive layout design using CSS Flexbox
- Responsive behavior using CSS media queries
- Clean separation of content and presentation via external CSS

## CSS Concepts Learned
- Flexbox layout for aligning navigation items, content sections, and pricing cards
- Fixed positioning to keep the navigation bar visible at the top of the screen
- Media queries to adjust layout and spacing for smaller screens
- Box model control using margin, padding, and borders
- Responsive sizing to ensure the page works well on desktop and mobile devices

## Key Concepts Explained (For Future Reference)
- **Semantic HTML:** HTML elements that clearly describe their role, improving accessibility and maintainability
- **Anchor navigation:** Clicking links that scroll to sections on the same page using element IDs
- **Fixed navigation bar:** A header that remains visible while the page content scrolls
- **HTML5 form validation:** Letting the browser validate email input without using JavaScript
- **Flexbox:** A CSS layout system that simplifies alignment and spacing of elements
- **Media query:** CSS rules that apply only under specific screen size conditions

## Files Included
- `index.html` — HTML structure for the product landing page
- `styles.css` — CSS for layout, styling, responsiveness, and navigation behavior

## Notes
This project was completed to practice building real-world product landing pages using only HTML and CSS.  
It reinforces core front-end fundamentals such as semantic markup, responsive layout techniques, and clean separation of structure and styling commonly used in professional web development.
